# Dynamic Image Processing Sketch

## Overview

This Processing sketch creates a mesmerizing, interactive visual display of colorful, moving circles. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of Processing for creating dynamic, responsive visual art.

## Features

- **Dynamic Animation**: Multiple circles move across the screen, bouncing off the edges.
- **Vibrant Color Palette**: Utilizes HSB color mode for a rich, diverse color scheme.
- **Transparency Effects**: Semi-transparent circles create interesting overlays and blends.
